## Configuration files

### Terminal and shell:
- [gnome-terminal](/gnome-terminal.conf) (using [term-prof](https://github.com/Sorebit/bin/blob/master/term-prof) to load and dump profiles) (urxvt is broken)
- [zsh](/.zshrc) + [oh-my-zsh](/.oh-my-zsh/themes)
- [tmux](/.tmux.conf) (a little bit messy, but pretty usable)

### Editors:
- [Vim](/.vimrc)
- [Sublime Text 3](/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User)

## Installation
The file hierarchy is kept as seen from `$HOME`.
To install just copy needed files/folders to your `$HOME`.

(I might write a script to do that in the future)
